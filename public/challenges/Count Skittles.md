You dropped your packet of Skittles on the floor and now there's Skittles everywhere. This reminded you about a bit in a Derren Brown show you once saw that after a smack to the face, he was able to instantly count all the items on a tray. You decide you want to try this. You proceed to smack yourself in the face, but then you realize you have no way to test if you're right.

Write a function `countSkittles` where given a string of skittle color abbreviations it returns a string of colors followed by the number of occurences it had in the original string. The color abbreviations are as follows:

r: Red  
l: Lime  
b: Blue  
y: Yellow  
o: Orange  
p: Purple  
i: Pink

For example `countSkittles('ryrryl')` should return `'Red3 Yellow2 Lime1'`

*note: the colors should appear in the order the abbreviations appear, so for the above example, Red appears first, followed by Yellow, followed finally by Lime
