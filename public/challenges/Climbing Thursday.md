Write a function named `climbingThursday` that returns a boolean representing whether or not Chovin will be rock climbing Thursday. This function should take 3 arguments:

1. `feeling_like_it` for whether or not he feels like it
1. `climbed_last_week` for whether or not he climbed last week
1. `week` for the number of the week this year (starting at 0)

Chovin usually climbs on Saturday but every so often he climbs on Thursday. He goes climbing on Thursday if he feels like it or if he hasn't climbed last week. He also climbs Thursday every 3rd week (2,5,8,...) of the year since he has to go to Merizo on Saturday.
