You love food and as such you only care about emails you receive if they contain your favorite foods. All non-food related emails can go straight to your junk folder. To help with this, write a function `hasFood` that when given email contents as a string, it returns true for if you should read the email or false if it should be sent to your junk folder. Your favorite foods are:

1. Fried Chicken
2. Fries
3. Burger
4. Cheese
5. Acai

*note: your function should ignore the case the foods in the emails. For example `'FRIES'` and `'fries'` should both return `true`
