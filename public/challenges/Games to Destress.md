You and your coding buddies are done with a big project and want to play a game together to destress. Each person has accumulated a certain amount of stress indicated by an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive. You all agree to choose a game to play based on the average amount of stress you all have accumulated (rounded up). The list of games sorted by least amount of stress to most amount of stress is:

1. Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes
1. Escape Simulator
1. Borderlands 3
1. Minecraft
1. Monopoly Deal

Write a function named `pickGame` which takes an array of your friends' stress levels and returns the game choice you all should play. 

For example: `pickGame([1,2,2,1,3])` should return `"Escape Simulator"`
