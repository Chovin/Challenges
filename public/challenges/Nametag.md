You're tasked with printing out nametags for an event. Write a function named `nametag` that takes a list of name parts and combines them to make a nametag. The name parts are one or more of:

1. first name
2. full middle name or
3. middle initial
4. last name

The name parts also might come in uppercase or lowercase. They will need to be converted to titlecase

The format of the nametag should be: `'Hello, my name is Joe M. Smith'`. Notice that if there is a middle initial, it should have a period after it.
