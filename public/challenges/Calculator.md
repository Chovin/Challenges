Your TI-89 graphing calculator broke! You're a programmer, so I guess you have no choice but to make your own calculator from scratch.

Write a function `calculate` that takes in calculator input as a list and returns the calculated answer. The operators you should implement are `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`. Make sure dividing by zero returns `Infinity`

For example, `calculate([2, '+', 3])` should return `5`

*note: the calculator input will always be a 3 item array
